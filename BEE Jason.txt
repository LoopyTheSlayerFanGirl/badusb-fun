STRING According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly.
ENTER
STRING Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground.
ENTER
STRING The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.
ENTER
STRING Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
ENTER
STRING Ooh, black and yellow!
ENTER
STRING Let's shake it up a little.
ENTER
STRING Barry! Breakfast is ready!
ENTER
STRING Coming!
ENTER
STRING Hang on a second.
ENTER
STRING Hello?
ENTER
STRING Barry?
ENTER
STRING Adam?
ENTER
STRING Can you believe this is happening?
ENTER
STRING I can't.
ENTER
STRING I'll pick you up.
ENTER
STRING Looking sharp.
ENTER
STRING Use the stairs, Your father paid good money for those.
ENTER
STRING Sorry. I'm excited.
ENTER
STRING Here's the graduate.
ENTER
STRING We're very proud of you, son.
ENTER
STRING A perfect report card, all B's.
ENTER
STRING Very proud.
ENTER
STRING Ma! I got a thing going here.
ENTER
STRING You got lint on your fuzz.
ENTER
STRING Ow! That's me!
ENTER
STRING Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
ENTER
STRING ENTER
ENTER
STRING STRING Bye!
ENTER
STRING Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house!
ENTER
STRING Hey, Adam.
ENTER
STRING Hey, Barry.
ENTER
STRING Is that fuzz gel?
ENTER
STRING A little. Special day, graduation.
ENTER
STRING Never thought I'd make it.
ENTER
STRING Three days grade school, three days high school.
ENTER
STRING Those were awkward.
ENTER
STRING Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around The Hive.
ENTER
STRING You did come back different.
ENTER
STRING Hi, Barry. Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.
ENTER
STRING Hear about Frankie?
ENTER
STRING Yeah.
ENTER
STRING You going to the funeral?
ENTER
STRING No, I'm not going.
ENTER
STRING Everybody knows, sting someone, you die.
ENTER
STRING Don't waste it on a squirrel.
ENTER
STRING Such a hothead.
ENTER
STRING I guess he could have just gotten out of the way.
ENTER
STRING I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day.
ENTER
STRING That's why we don't need vacations.
ENTER
STRING Boy, quite a bit of pomp under the circumstances.
ENTER
STRING Well, Adam, today we are men.
ENTER
STRING We are!
ENTER
STRING Bee-men.
ENTER
STRING Amen!
ENTER
STRING Hallelujah!
ENTER
STRING Students, faculty, distinguished bees,
ENTER
STRING please welcome Dean Buzzwell.
ENTER
STRING Welcome, New Hive City graduating class of 9:15.
ENTER
STRING That concludes our ceremonies And begins your career at Honex Industries!
ENTER
STRING Will we pick our job today?
ENTER
STRING I heard it's just orientation.
ENTER
STRING Heads up! Here we go.
ENTER
STRING Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times.
ENTER
STRING Wonder what it'll be like?
ENTER
STRING A little scary.
ENTER
STRING Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group.
ENTER
STRING This is it!
ENTER
STRING Wow.
ENTER
STRING Wow.
ENTER
STRING We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.
ENTER
STRING Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to The Hive.
ENTER
STRING Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey!
ENTER
STRING That girl was hot.
ENTER
STRING She's my cousin!
ENTER
STRING She is?
ENTER
STRING Yes, we're all cousins.
ENTER
STRING Right. You're right.
ENTER
STRING At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence.
ENTER
STRING These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology.
ENTER
STRING What do you think he makes?
ENTER
STRING Not enough.
ENTER
STRING Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman.
ENTER
STRING What does that do?
ENTER
STRING Catches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it.
ENTER
STRING Saves us millions.
ENTER
STRING Can anyone work on the Krelman?
ENTER
STRING Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones.
ENTER
STRING But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot.
ENTER
STRING But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life.
ENTER
STRING The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that.
ENTER
STRING What's the difference?
ENTER
STRING You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years.
ENTER
STRING So you'll just work us to death?
ENTER
STRING We'll sure try.
ENTER
STRING Wow! That blew my mind!
ENTER
STRING "What's the difference?"
ENTER
STRING How can you say that?
ENTER
STRING One job forever?
ENTER
STRING That's an insane choice to have to make.
ENTER
STRING I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life.
ENTER
STRING But, Adam, how could they never have told us that?
ENTER
STRING Why would you question anything? We're bees.
ENTER
STRING We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.
ENTER
STRING You ever think maybe things work a little too well here?
ENTER
STRING Like what? Give me one example.
ENTER
STRING I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about.
ENTER
STRING Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach.
ENTER
STRING Wait a second. Check it out.
ENTER
STRING Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
ENTER
STRING Wow.
ENTER
STRING I've never seen them this close.
ENTER
STRING They know what it's like outside The Hive.
ENTER
STRING Yeah, but some don't come back.
ENTER
STRING Hey, Jocks!
ENTER
STRING Hi, Jocks!
ENTER
STRING You guys did great!
ENTER
STRING You're monsters!
ENTER
STRING You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!
ENTER
STRING I wonder where they were.
ENTER
STRING I don't know.
ENTER
STRING Their day's not planned.
ENTER
STRING Outside The Hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what.
ENTER
STRING You can't just decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that.
ENTER
STRING Right.
ENTER
STRING Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime.
ENTER
STRING It's just a status symbol.
ENTER
STRING Bees make too much of it.
ENTER
STRING Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it.
ENTER
STRING Those ladies?
ENTER
STRING Aren't they our cousins too?
ENTER
STRING Distant. Distant.
ENTER
STRING Look at these two.
ENTER
STRING Couple of Hive Harrys.
ENTER
STRING Let's have fun with them.
ENTER
STRING It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock.
ENTER
STRING Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom!
ENTER
STRING He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me!
ENTER
STRING Oh, my!
ENTER
STRING I never thought I'd knock him out.
ENTER
STRING What were you doing during this?
ENTER
STRING Trying to alert the authorities.
ENTER
STRING I can autograph that.
ENTER
STRING A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades?
ENTER
STRING Yeah. Gusty.
ENTER
STRING We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow.
ENTER
STRING Six miles, huh?
ENTER
STRING Barry!
ENTER
STRING A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it.
ENTER
STRING Maybe I am.
ENTER
STRING You are not!
ENTER
STRING We're going 0900 at J-Gate.
ENTER
STRING What do you think, buzzy-boy?
ENTER
STRING Are you bee enough?
ENTER
STRING I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means.
ENTER
STRING Hey, Honex!
ENTER
STRING Dad, you surprised me.
ENTER
STRING You decide what you're interested in?
ENTER
STRING Well, there's a lot of choices.
ENTER
STRING But you only get one.
ENTER
STRING Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day?
ENTER
STRING Son, let me tell you about stirring.
ENTER
STRING You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around.
ENTER
STRING You get yourself into a rhythm.
ENTER
STRING It's a beautiful thing.
ENTER
STRING You know, Dad, the more I think about it,
ENTER
STRING maybe the honey field just isn't right for me.
ENTER
STRING You were thinking of what, making balloon animals?
ENTER
STRING That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger.
ENTER
STRING Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey!
ENTER
STRING Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
ENTER
STRING I'm not trying to be funny.
ENTER
STRING You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer!
ENTER
STRING You're gonna be a stirrer?
ENTER
STRING No one's listening to me!
ENTER
STRING Wait till you see the sticks I have.
ENTER
STRING I could say anything right now.
ENTER
STRING I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!
ENTER
STRING Let's open some honey and celebrate!
ENTER
STRING Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody "dawg"!
ENTER
STRING I'm so proud.
ENTER
STRING We're starting work today!
ENTER
STRING Today's the day.
ENTER
STRING Come on! All the good jobs will be gone.
ENTER
STRING Yeah, right.
ENTER
STRING Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal...
ENTER
STRING Is it still available?
ENTER
STRING Hang on. Two left!
ENTER
STRING One of them's yours! Congratulations!
ENTER
STRING Step to the side.
ENTER
STRING What'd you get?
ENTER
STRING Picking crud out. Stellar!
ENTER
STRING Wow!
ENTER
STRING Couple of newbies?
ENTER
STRING Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!
ENTER
STRING Make your choice.
ENTER
STRING You want to go first?
ENTER
STRING No, you go.
ENTER
STRING Oh, my. What's available?
ENTER
STRING Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think.
ENTER
STRING Any chance of getting the Krelman?
ENTER
STRING Sure, you're on.
ENTER
STRING I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.
ENTER
STRING Wax monkey's always open.
ENTER
STRING The Krelman opened up again.
ENTER
STRING What happened?
ENTER
STRING A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one.
ENTER
STRING Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.
ENTER
STRING Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life!
ENTER
STRING Oh, this is so hard!
ENTER
STRING Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler.
ENTER
STRING Barry, what do you think I should... Barry?
ENTER
STRING Barry!
ENTER
STRING All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine...
ENTER
STRING What happened to you?
ENTER
STRING Where are you?
ENTER
STRING I'm going out.
ENTER
STRING Out? Out where?
ENTER
STRING Out there.
ENTER
STRING Oh, no!
ENTER
STRING I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life.
ENTER
STRING You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?
ENTER
STRING Another call coming in.
ENTER
STRING If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today.
ENTER
STRING Hey, guys.
ENTER
STRING Look at that.
ENTER
STRING Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?
ENTER
STRING Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.
ENTER
STRING It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.
ENTER
STRING Really? Feeling lucky, are you?
ENTER
STRING Sign here, here. Just initial that.
ENTER
STRING Thank you.
ENTER
STRING OK.
ENTER
STRING You got a rain advisory today, and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain.
ENTER
STRING So be careful. As always, watch your brooms, hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats.
ENTER
STRING Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us.
ENTER
STRING Murphy's in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada!
ENTER
STRING That's awful.
ENTER
STRING And a reminder for you rookies, bee law number one, absolutely no talking to humans!
ENTER
STRING  All right, launch positions!
ENTER
STRING Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!
ENTER
STRING Black and yellow!
ENTER
STRING Hello!
ENTER
STRING You ready for this, hot shot?
ENTER
STRING Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.
ENTER
STRING Wind, check.
ENTER
STRING Antennae, check.
ENTER
STRING Nectar pack, check.
ENTER
STRING Wings, check.
ENTER
STRING Stinger, check.
ENTER
STRING Scared out of my shorts, check.
ENTER
STRING OK, ladies,
ENTER
STRING let's move it out!
ENTER
STRING Pound those petunias, you striped stem-suckers!
ENTER
STRING All of you, drain those flowers!
ENTER
STRING Wow! I'm out!
ENTER
STRING I can't believe I'm out!
ENTER
STRING So blue.
ENTER
STRING I feel so fast and free!
ENTER
STRING Box kite!
ENTER
STRING Wow!
ENTER
STRING Flowers!
ENTER
STRING This is Blue Leader, We have roses visual.
ENTER
STRING Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.
ENTER
STRING Roses!
ENTER
STRING 30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.
ENTER
STRING Stand to the side, kid.
ENTER
STRING It's got a bit of a kick.
ENTER
STRING That is one nectar collector!
ENTER
STRING Ever see pollination up close?
ENTER
STRING No, sir.
ENTER
STRING I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there, a pinch on that one.
ENTER
STRING See that? It's a little bit of magic.
ENTER
STRING That's amazing. Why do we do that?
ENTER
STRING That's pollen power. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.
ENTER
STRING Cool.
ENTER
STRING I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow, Could be daisies, Don't we need those?
ENTER
STRING Copy that visual.
ENTER
STRING Wait. One of these flowers seems to be on the move.
ENTER
STRING Say again? You're reporting a moving flower?
ENTER
STRING Affirmative.
ENTER
STRING That was on the line!
ENTER
STRING This is the coolest. What is it?
ENTER
STRING I don't know, but I'm loving this color.
ENTER
STRING It smells good.
ENTER
STRING Not like a flower, but I like it.
ENTER
STRING Yeah, fuzzy.
ENTER
STRING Chemical-y.
ENTER
STRING Careful, guys. It's a little grabby.
ENTER
STRING My sweet lord of bees!
ENTER
STRING Candy-brain, get off there!
ENTER
STRING Problem!
ENTER
STRING Guys!
ENTER
STRING This could be bad.
ENTER
STRING Affirmative.
ENTER
STRING Very close.
ENTER
STRING Gonna hurt.
ENTER
STRING Mama's little boy.
ENTER
STRING You are way out of position, rookie!
ENTER
STRING Coming in at you like a missile!
ENTER
STRING Help me!
ENTER
STRING I don't think these are flowers.
ENTER
STRING Should we tell him?
ENTER
STRING I think he knows.
ENTER
STRING What is this?!
ENTER
STRING Match point!
ENTER
STRING You can start packing up, honey, because you're about to eat it!
ENTER
STRING Yowser!
ENTER
STRING Gross.
ENTER
STRING There's a bee in the car!
ENTER
STRING Do something!
ENTER
STRING I'm driving!
ENTER
STRING Hi, bee.
ENTER
STRING He's back here!
ENTER
STRING He's going to sting me!
ENTER
STRING Nobody move. If you don't move, he won't sting you. Freeze!
ENTER
STRING He blinked!
ENTER
STRING Spray him, Granny!
ENTER
STRING What are you doing?!
ENTER
STRING Wow... the tension level out here is unbelievable.
ENTER
STRING I gotta get home.
ENTER
STRING Can't fly in rain. Can't fly in rain. Can't fly in rain.
ENTER
STRING Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!
ENTER
STRING Ken, could you close the window please?
ENTER
STRING Ken, could you close the window please?
ENTER
STRING Check out my new resume. I made it into a fold-out brochure. You see? Folds out.
ENTER
STRING Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.
ENTER
STRING What was that?
ENTER
STRING Maybe this time. This time. This time. This time! This time! This... Drapes!
ENTER
STRING That is diabolical.
ENTER
STRING It's fantastic. It's got all my special skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.
ENTER
STRING What's number one? Star Wars?
ENTER
STRING Nah, I don't go for that... kind of stuff.
ENTER
STRING No wonder we shouldn't talk to them. They're out of their minds.
ENTER
STRING When I leave a job interview, they're flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.
ENTER
STRING There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.
ENTER
STRING I don't remember the sun having a big 75 on it.
ENTER
STRING I predicted global warming. I could feel it getting hotter. At first I thought it was just me.
ENTER
STRING Wait! Stop! Bee!
ENTER
STRING Stand back. These are winter boots.
ENTER
STRING Wait!
ENTER
STRING Don't kill him!
ENTER
STRING You know I'm allergic to them! This thing could kill me!
ENTER
STRING Why does his life have less value than yours?
ENTER
STRING Why does his life have any less value than mine? Is that your statement?
ENTER
STRING I'm just saying all life has value. You don't know what he's capable of feeling.
ENTER
STRING My brochure!
ENTER
STRING There you go, little guy.
ENTER
STRING I'm not scared of him.It's an allergic thing.
ENTER
STRING  Put that on your resume brochure.
ENTER
STRING My whole face could puff up.
ENTER
STRING Make it one of your special skills.
ENTER
STRING Knocking someone out is also a special skill.
ENTER
STRING Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.
ENTER
STRING Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?
ENTER
STRING Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.
ENTER
STRING You could put carob chips on there.
ENTER
STRING Bye.
ENTER
STRING Supposed to be less calories.
ENTER
STRING Bye.
ENTER
STRING I gotta say something. She saved my life. I gotta say something.
ENTER
STRING All right, here it goes.
ENTER
STRING Nah.
ENTER
STRING What would I say?
ENTER
STRING I could really get in trouble. It's a bee law. You're not supposed to talk to a human.
ENTER
STRING I can't believe I'm doing this. I've got to.
ENTER
STRING Oh, I can't do it. Come on!
ENTER
STRING No. Yes. No. Do it. I can't.
ENTER
STRING How should I start it? "You like jazz?" No, that's no good.
ENTER
STRING Here she comes! Speak, you fool!
ENTER
STRING Hi!
ENTER
STRING I'm sorry. You're talking.
ENTER
STRING Yes, I know.
ENTER
STRING You're talking!
ENTER
STRING I'm so sorry.
ENTER
STRING No, it's OK. It's fine.
ENTER
STRING I know I'm dreaming. But I don't recall going to bed.
ENTER
STRING Well, I'm sure this is very disconcerting.
ENTER
STRING This is a bit of a surprise to me. I mean, you're a bee!
ENTER
STRING I am. And I'm not supposed to be doing this, but they were all trying to kill me.
ENTER
STRING And if it wasn't for you... I had to thank you. It's just how I was raised.
ENTER
STRING That was a little weird. I'm talking with a bee.
ENTER
STRING Yeah.
ENTER
STRING I'm talking to a bee. And the bee is talking to me!
ENTER
STRING I just want to say I'm grateful.
ENTER
STRING I'll leave now.
ENTER
STRING Wait! How did you learn to do that?
ENTER
STRING What?
ENTER
STRING The talking thing.
ENTER
STRING Same way you did, I guess. "Mama, Dada, honey." You pick it up.
ENTER
STRING That's very funny.
ENTER
STRING Yeah.
ENTER
STRING Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh, we'd cry with what we have to deal with.
ENTER
STRING Anyway... Can I... get you something?
ENTER
STRING Like what?
ENTER
STRING I don't know. I mean... I don't know. Coffee?
ENTER
STRING I don't want to put you out.
ENTER
STRING It's no trouble. It takes two minutes.
ENTER
STRING It's just coffee.
ENTER
STRING I hate to impose.
ENTER
STRING Don't be ridiculous!
ENTER
STRING Actually, I would love a cup.
ENTER
STRING Hey, you want rum cake?
ENTER
STRING I shouldn't.
ENTER
STRING Have some.
ENTER
STRING No, I can't.
ENTER
STRING Come on!
ENTER
STRING I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.
ENTER
STRING Where?
ENTER
STRING These stripes don't help.
ENTER
STRING You look great!
ENTER
STRING I don't know if you know anything about fashion.
ENTER
STRING Are you all right?
ENTER
STRING No.
ENTER
STRING He's making the tie in the cab as they're flying up Madison.
ENTER
STRING He finally gets there.
ENTER
STRING He runs up the steps into the church.
ENTER
STRING The wedding is on.
ENTER
STRING And he says, "Watermelon?
ENTER
STRING I thought you said Guatemalan.
ENTER
STRING Why would I marry a watermelon?"
ENTER
STRING Is that a bee joke?
ENTER
STRING That's the kind of stuff we do.
ENTER
STRING Yeah, different.
ENTER
STRING So, what are you gonna do, Barry?
ENTER
STRING About work? I don't know.
ENTER
STRING I want to do my part for The Hive, but I can't do it the way they want.
ENTER
STRING I know how you feel.
ENTER
STRING You do?
ENTER
STRING Sure.
ENTER
STRING My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.
ENTER
STRING Really?
ENTER
STRING My only interest is flowers.
ENTER
STRING Our new queen was just elected with that same campaign slogan.
ENTER
STRING Anyway, if you look... There's my hive right there. See it?
ENTER
STRING You're in Sheep Meadow!
ENTER
STRING Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!
ENTER
STRING No way! I know that area. I lost a toe ring there once.
ENTER
STRING Why do girls put rings on their toes?
ENTER
STRING Why not?
ENTER
STRING It's like putting a hat on your knee.
ENTER
STRING Maybe I'll try that.
ENTER
STRING You all right, ma'am?
ENTER
STRING Oh, yeah. Fine.
ENTER
STRING Just having two cups of coffee!
ENTER
STRING Anyway, this has been great.
ENTER
STRING Thanks for the coffee.
ENTER
STRING Yeah, it's no trouble.
ENTER
STRING Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did, I'd be up the rest of my life.
ENTER
STRING Are you...?
ENTER
STRING Can I take a piece of this with me?
ENTER
STRING Sure! Here, have a crumb.
ENTER
STRING Thanks!
ENTER
STRING Yeah.
ENTER
STRING All right. Well, then... I guess I'll see you around. Or not.
ENTER
STRING OK, Barry.
ENTER
STRING And thank you so much again... for before.
ENTER
STRING Oh, that? That was nothing.
ENTER
STRING Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...
ENTER
STRING This can't possibly work.
ENTER
STRING He's all set to go.
ENTER
STRING We may as well try it.
ENTER
STRING OK, Dave, pull the chute.
ENTER
STRING Sounds amazing.
ENTER
STRING It was amazing!
ENTER
STRING It was the scariest, happiest moment of my life.
ENTER
STRING Humans! I can't believe you were with humans!
ENTER
STRING Giant, scary humans!
ENTER
STRING What were they like?
ENTER
STRING Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.
ENTER
STRING They eat crazy giant things.
ENTER
STRING They drive crazy.
ENTER
STRING Do they try and kill you, like on TV?
ENTER
STRING Some of them. But some of them don't.
ENTER
STRING How'd you get back?
ENTER
STRING Poodle.
ENTER
STRING You did it, and I'm glad. You saw whatever you wanted to see.
ENTER
STRING You had your "experience." Now you can pick out yourjob and be normal.
ENTER
STRING Well...
ENTER
STRING Well?
ENTER
STRING Well, I met someone.
ENTER
STRING You did? Was she Bee-ish?
ENTER
STRING A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!
ENTER
STRING No, no, no, not a wasp.
ENTER
STRING Spider?
ENTER
STRING I'm not attracted to spiders.
ENTER
STRING I know it's the hottest thing, with the eight legs and all. I can't get by that face.
ENTER
STRING So who is she?
ENTER
STRING She's... human.
ENTER
STRING No, no. That's a bee law. You wouldn't break a bee law.
ENTER
STRING Her name's Vanessa.
ENTER
STRING Oh, boy.
ENTER
STRING She's so nice. And she's a florist!
ENTER
STRING Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!
ENTER
STRING We're not dating.
ENTER
STRING You're flying outside The Hive, talking to humans that attack our homes with power washers and M-80s! One-eighth a stick of dynamite!
ENTER
STRING She saved my life! And she understands me.
ENTER
STRING This is over!
ENTER
STRING Eat this.
ENTER
STRING This is not over! What was that?
ENTER
STRING They call it a crumb.
ENTER
STRING It was so stingin' stripey!
ENTER
STRING And that's not what they eat.
ENTER
STRING That's what falls off what they eat!
ENTER
STRING You know what a Cinnabon is?
ENTER
STRING No.
ENTER
STRING It's bread and cinnamon and frosting. They heat it up...
ENTER
STRING Sit down!
ENTER
STRING ...really hot!
ENTER
STRING Listen to me!
ENTER
STRING We are not them! We're us.
ENTER
STRING There's us and there's them!
ENTER
STRING Yes, but who can deny the heart that is yearning?
ENTER
STRING There's no yearning. Stop yearning. Listen to me!
ENTER
STRING You have got to start thinking bee, my friend. Thinking bee!
ENTER
STRING Thinking bee.
ENTER
STRING Thinking bee.
ENTER
STRING Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
ENTER
STRING There he is. He's in the pool.
ENTER
STRING You know what your problem is, Barry?
ENTER
STRING I gotta start thinking bee?
ENTER
STRING How much longer will this go on?
ENTER
STRING It's been three days! Why aren't you working?
ENTER
STRING I've got a lot of big life decisions to think about.
ENTER
STRING What life? You have no life!
ENTER
STRING You have no job. You're barely a bee!
ENTER
STRING Would it kill you to make a little honey?
ENTER
STRING Barry, come out. Your father's talking to you.
ENTER
STRING Martin, would you talk to him?
ENTER
STRING Barry, I'm talking to you!
ENTER
STRING You coming?
ENTER
STRING Got everything?
ENTER
STRING All set!
ENTER
STRING Go ahead. I'll catch up.
ENTER
STRING Don't be too long.
ENTER
STRING Watch this!
ENTER
STRING Vanessa!
ENTER
STRING We're still here.
ENTER
STRING I told you not to yell at him.
ENTER
STRING He doesn't respond to yelling!
ENTER
STRING Then why yell at me?
ENTER
STRING Because you don't listen!
ENTER
STRING I'm not listening to this.
ENTER
STRING Sorry, I've gotta go.
ENTER
STRING Where are you going?
ENTER
STRING I'm meeting a friend.
ENTER
STRING A girl? Is this why you can't decide?
ENTER
STRING Bye.
ENTER
STRING I just hope she's Bee-ish.
ENTER
STRING They have a huge parade of flowers every year in Pasadena?
ENTER
STRING To be in the Tournament of Roses, that's every florist's dream!
ENTER
STRING Up on a float, surrounded by flowers, crowds cheering.
ENTER
STRING A tournament. Do the roses compete in athletic events?
ENTER
STRING No. All right, I've got one.
ENTER
STRING How come you don't fly everywhere?
ENTER
STRING It's exhausting. Why don't you run everywhere? It's faster.
ENTER
STRING Yeah, OK, I see, I see.
ENTER
STRING All right, your turn.
ENTER
STRING TiVo. You can just freeze live TV? That's insane!
ENTER
STRING You don't have that?
ENTER
STRING We have Hivo, but it's a disease. It's a horrible, horrible disease.
ENTER
STRING Oh, my.
ENTER
STRING Dumb bees!
ENTER
STRING You must want to sting all those jerks.
ENTER
STRING We try not to sting. It's usually fatal for us.
ENTER
STRING So you have to watch your temper.
ENTER
STRING Very carefully.
ENTER
STRING You kick a wall, take a walk, write an angry letter and throw it out. Work through it like any emotion: Anger, jealousy, lust.
ENTER
STRING Oh, my goodness! Are you OK?
ENTER
STRING Yeah.
ENTER
STRING What is wrong with you?!
ENTER
STRING It's a bug.
ENTER
STRING He's not bothering anybody.
ENTER
STRING Get out of here, you creep!
ENTER
STRING What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular?
ENTER
STRING Yeah, it was. How did you know?
ENTER
STRING It felt like about 10 pages. Seventy-five is pretty much our limit.
ENTER
STRING You've really got that down to a science.
ENTER
STRING I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue.
ENTER
STRING I'll bet.
ENTER
STRING What in the name of Mighty Hercules is this?
ENTER
STRING How did this get here? cute Bee, Golden Blossom, Ray Liotta Private Select?
ENTER
STRING Is he that actor?
ENTER
STRING I never heard of him.
ENTER
STRING Why is this here?
ENTER
STRING For people. We eat it.
ENTER
STRING You don't have enough food of your own?
ENTER
STRING Well, yes.
ENTER
STRING How do you get it?
ENTER
STRING Bees make it.
ENTER
STRING I know who makes it! And it's hard to make it!
ENTER
STRING There's heating, cooling, stirring. You need a whole Krelman thing!
ENTER
STRING It's organic.
ENTER
STRING It's our-ganic!
ENTER
STRING It's just honey, Barry.
ENTER
STRING Just what?!
ENTER
STRING Bees don't know about this! This is stealing! A lot of stealing!
ENTER
STRING You've taken our homes, schools,hospitals! This is all we have!
ENTER
STRING And it's on sale?! I'm getting to the bottom of this.
ENTER
STRING I'm getting to the bottom of all of this!
ENTER
STRING Hey, Hector. You almost done?
ENTER
STRING Almost.
ENTER
STRING He is here. I sense it.
ENTER
STRING Well, I guess I'll go home now and just leave this nice honey out, with no one around.
ENTER
STRING You're busted, box boy!
ENTER
STRING I knew I heard something.
ENTER
STRING So you can talk!
ENTER
STRING I can talk. And now you'll start talking!
ENTER
STRING Where you getting the sweet stuff? Who's your supplier?
ENTER
STRING I don't understand.
ENTER
STRING I thought we were friends.
ENTER
STRING The last thing we want to do is upset bees!
ENTER
STRING You're too late! It's ours now!
ENTER
STRING You, sir, have crossed the wrong sword!
ENTER
STRING You, sir, will be lunch for my iguana, Ignacio!
ENTER
STRING Where is the honey coming from? Tell me where!
ENTER
STRING Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms!
ENTER
STRING Crazy person!
ENTER
STRING What horrible thing has happened here?
ENTER
STRING These faces, they never knew what hit them. And now
ENTER
STRING they're on the road to nowhere!
ENTER
STRING Just keep still.
ENTER
STRING What? You're not dead?
ENTER
STRING Do I look dead? They will wipe anything that moves. Where you headed?
ENTER
STRING To Honey Farms. I am onto something huge here.
ENTER
STRING I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood, crazy stuff. Blows your head off!
ENTER
STRING I'm going to Tacoma.
ENTER
STRING And you?
ENTER
STRING He really is dead.
ENTER
STRING All right.
ENTER
STRING Uh-oh!
ENTER
STRING What is that?!
ENTER
STRING Oh, no!
ENTER
STRING A wiper! Triple blade!
ENTER
STRING Triple blade?
ENTER
STRING Jump on! It's your only chance, bee!
ENTER
STRING Why does everything have
ENTER
STRING to be so doggone clean?!
ENTER
STRING How much do you people need to see?!
ENTER
STRING Open your eyes!
ENTER
STRING Stick your head out the window!
ENTER
STRING From NPR News in Washington,
ENTER
STRING I'm Carl Kasell.
ENTER
STRING But don't kill no more bugs!
ENTER
STRING Bee!
ENTER
STRING Moose blood guy!!
ENTER
STRING You hear something?
ENTER
STRING Like what?
ENTER
STRING Like tiny screaming.
ENTER
STRING Turn off the radio.
ENTER
STRING Whassup, bee boy?
ENTER
STRING Hey, Blood.
ENTER
STRING Just a row of honey jars, as far as the eye could see.
ENTER
STRING Wow!
ENTER
STRING I assume wherever this truck goes is where they're getting it. I mean, that honey's ours.
ENTER
STRING Bees hang tight. We're all jammed in.
ENTER
STRING It's a close community.
ENTER
STRING Not us, man. We on our own. Every mosquito on his own.
ENTER
STRING What if you get in trouble?
ENTER
STRING You a mosquito, you in trouble. Nobody likes us. They just smack. See a mosquito, smack, smack!
ENTER
STRING At least you're out in the world. You must meet girls.
ENTER
STRING Mosquito girls try to trade up, get with a moth, dragonfly. Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito.
ENTER
STRING You got to be kidding me!
ENTER
STRING Mooseblood's about to leave the building! So long, bee!
ENTER
STRING Hey, guys!
ENTER
STRING Mooseblood!
ENTER
STRING I knew I'd catch y'all down here.
ENTER
STRING Did you bring your crazy straw?
ENTER
STRING We throw it in jars, slap a label on it, and it's pretty much pure profit.
ENTER
STRING What is this place?
ENTER
STRING A bee's got a brain the size of a pinhead.
ENTER
STRING They are pinheads!
ENTER
STRING Pinhead.
ENTER
STRING Check out the new smoker.
ENTER
STRING Oh, sweet. That's the one you want. The Thomas 3000!
ENTER
STRING Smoker?
ENTER
STRING Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic. Twice the nicotine, all the tar. A couple breaths of this knocks them right out.
ENTER
STRING They make the honey, and we make the money.
ENTER
STRING "They make the honey, and we make the money"?
ENTER
STRING Oh, my!
ENTER
STRING What's going on? Are you OK?
ENTER
STRING Yeah. It doesn't last too long.
ENTER
STRING Do you know you're in a fake hive with fake walls?
ENTER
STRING Our queen was moved here. We had no choice.
ENTER
STRING This is your queen? That's a man in women's clothes! That's a drag queen!
ENTER
STRING What is this?
ENTER
STRING Oh, no!
ENTER
STRING There's hundreds of them!
ENTER
STRING Bee honey.
ENTER
STRING Our honey is being brazenly stolen on a massive scale!
ENTER
STRING This is worse than anything bears have done! I intend to do something.
ENTER
STRING Oh, Barry, stop.
ENTER
STRING Who told you humans are taking our honey? That's a rumor.
ENTER
STRING Do these look like rumors?
ENTER
STRING That's a conspiracy theory. These are obviously doctored photos. How did you get mixed up in this?
ENTER
STRING He's been talking to humans.
ENTER
STRING What? Talking to humans?!
ENTER
STRING He has a human girlfriend. And they make out!
ENTER
STRING Make out? Barry!
ENTER
STRING We do not.
ENTER
STRING You wish you could.
ENTER
STRING Whose side are you on?
ENTER
STRING The bees!
ENTER
STRING I dated a cricket once in San Antonio. Those crazy legs kept me up all night.
ENTER
STRING Barry, this is what you want to do with your life?
ENTER
STRING I want to do it for all our lives. Nobody works harder than bees!
ENTER
STRING Dad, I remember you coming home so overworked
ENTER
STRING your hands were still stirring. You couldn't stop.
ENTER
STRING I remember that.
ENTER
STRING What right do they have to our honey?
ENTER
STRING We live on two cups a year. They put it in lip balm for no reason whatsoever!
ENTER
STRING Even if it's true, what can one bee do?
ENTER
STRING Sting them where it really hurts.
ENTER
STRING In the face! The eye!
ENTER
STRING That would hurt.
ENTER
STRING No.
ENTER
STRING Up the nose? That's a killer.
ENTER
STRING There's only one place you can sting the humans, one place where it matters.
ENTER
STRING Hive at Five, The Hive's only full-hour action news source.
ENTER
STRING No more bee beards!
ENTER
STRING With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk. Weather with Storm Stinger. Sports with Buzz Larvi. And Jeanette Chung.
ENTER
STRING Good evening. I'm Bob Bumble.
ENTER
STRING And I'm Jeanette Ohung.
ENTER
STRING A tri-county bee, Barry Benson, intends to sue the human race for stealing our honey, packaging it and profiting from it illegally!
ENTER
STRING Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King, we'll have three former queens here in our studio, discussing their new book, classy Ladies, out this week on Hexagon.
ENTER
STRING Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson.
ENTER
STRING Did you ever think, "I'm a kid from The Hive. I can't do this"?
ENTER
STRING Bees have never been afraid to change the world.
ENTER
STRING What about Bee Oolumbus? Bee Gandhi? Bejesus?
ENTER
STRING Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans.
ENTER
STRING We were thinking of stickball or candy stores.
ENTER
STRING How old are you?
ENTER
STRING The bee community is supporting you in this case, which will be the trial of the bee century.
ENTER
STRING You know, they have a Larry King in the human world too.
ENTER
STRING It's a common name. Next week...
ENTER
STRING He looks like you and has a show and suspenders and colored dots...
ENTER
STRING Next week...
ENTER
STRING Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the guest even though you just heard 'em.
ENTER
STRING Bear Week next week! They're scary, hairy and here live.
ENTER
STRING Always leans forward, pointy shoulders, squinty eyes, very Jewish.
ENTER
STRING In tennis, you attack at the point of weakness!
ENTER
STRING It was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81.
ENTER
STRING Honey, her backhand's a joke!
ENTER
STRING I'm not gonna take advantage of that?
ENTER
STRING Quiet, please.
ENTER
STRING Actual work going on here.
ENTER
STRING Is that that same bee?
ENTER
STRING Yes, it is!
ENTER
STRING I'm helping him sue the human race.
ENTER
STRING Hello.
ENTER
STRING Hello, bee.
ENTER
STRING This is Ken.
ENTER
STRING Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe.
ENTER
STRING Why does he talk again?
ENTER
STRING Listen, you better go 'cause we're really busy working.
ENTER
STRING But it's our yogurt night!
ENTER
STRING Bye-bye.
ENTER
STRING Why is yogurt night so difficult?!
ENTER
STRING You poor thing. You two have been at this for hours!
ENTER
STRING Yes, and Adam here has been a huge help.
ENTER
STRING Frosting...
ENTER
STRING How many sugars?
ENTER
STRING Just one. I try not to use the competition.
ENTER
STRING So why are you helping me?
ENTER
STRING Bees have good qualities. And it takes my mind off the shop. Instead of flowers, people are giving balloon bouquets now.
ENTER
STRING Those are great, if you're three.
ENTER
STRING And artificial flowers.
ENTER
STRING Oh, those just get me psychotic!
ENTER
STRING Yeah, me too.
ENTER
STRING Bent stingers, pointless pollination.
ENTER
STRING Bees must hate those fake things!
ENTER
STRING Nothing worse than a daffodil that's had work done.
ENTER
STRING Maybe this could make up for it a little bit.
ENTER
STRING This lawsuit's a pretty big deal.
ENTER
STRING I guess.
ENTER
STRING You sure you want to go through with it?
ENTER
STRING Am I sure? When I'm done with the humans, they won't be able to say, "Honey, I'm home," without paying a royalty!
ENTER
STRING It's an incredible scene here in downtown Manhattan, where the world anxiously waits, because for the first time in history, we will hear for ourselves if a honeybee can actually speak.
ENTER
STRING What have we gotten into here, Barry?
ENTER
STRING It's pretty big, isn't it?
ENTER
STRING I can't believe how many humans don't work during the day.
ENTER
STRING You think billion-dollar multinational food companies have good lawyers?
ENTER
STRING Everybody needs to stay behind the barricade.
ENTER
STRING What's the matter?
ENTER
STRING I don't know, I just got a chill.
ENTER
STRING Well, if it isn't the bee team.
ENTER
STRING You boys work on this?
ENTER
STRING All rise! The Honorable Judge Bumbleton presiding.
ENTER
STRING All right. Case number 4475,
ENTER
STRING Superior Court of New York,
ENTER
STRING Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry is now in session.
ENTER
STRING Mr. Montgomery, you're representing the five food companies collectively?
ENTER
STRING A privilege.
ENTER
STRING Mr. Benson... you're representing all the bees of the world?
ENTER
STRING I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor, we're ready to proceed.
ENTER
STRING Mr. Montgomery, your opening statement, please.
ENTER
STRING Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, my grandmother was a simple woman. Born on a farm, she believed it was man's divine right to benefit from the bounty of nature God put before us.
ENTER
STRING If we lived in the topsy-turvy world Mr. Benson imagines, just think of what would it mean.
ENTER
STRING I would have to negotiate with the silkworm for the elastic in my britches!
ENTER
STRING Talking bee!
ENTER
STRING How do we know this isn't some sort of holographic motion-picture-capture Hollywood wizardry?
ENTER
STRING They could be using laser beams! Robotics! Ventriloquism! Cloning! For all we know, he could be on steroids!
ENTER
STRING Mr. Benson?
ENTER
STRING Ladies and gentlemen, there's no trickery here. I'm just an ordinary bee. Honey's pretty important to me. It's important to all bees. We invented it! We make it. And we protect it with our lives.
ENTER
STRING Unfortunately, there are some people in this room who think they can take it from us 'cause we're the little guys!
ENTER
STRING I'm hoping that, after this is all over, you'll see how, by taking our honey, you not only take everything we have but everything we are!
ENTER
STRING I wish he'd dress like that all the time. So nice!
ENTER
STRING Call your first witness.
ENTER
STRING So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden of Honey Farms, big company you have.
ENTER
STRING I suppose so.
ENTER
STRING I see you also own Honeyburton and Honron!
ENTER
STRING Yes, they provide beekeepers for our farms.
ENTER
STRING Beekeeper. I find that to be a very disturbing term.
ENTER
STRING I don't imagine you employ any bee-free-ers, do you?
ENTER
STRING No.
ENTER
STRING I couldn't hear you.
ENTER
STRING No.
ENTER
STRING No. Because you don't free bees. You keep bees. Not only that, it seems you thought a bear would be an appropriate image for a jar of honey.
ENTER
STRING They're very lovable creatures. Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.
ENTER
STRING You mean like this?
ENTER
STRING Bears kill bees!
ENTER
STRING How'd you like his head crashing through your living room?! Biting into your couch! Spitting out your throw pillows! OK, that's enough. Take him away.
ENTER
STRING So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here. Your name intrigues me. Where have I heard it before?
ENTER
STRING I was with a band called The Police.
ENTER
STRING But you've never been a police officer, have you?
ENTER
STRING No, I haven't.
ENTER
STRING No, you haven't. And so here we have yet another example of bee culture casually stolen by a human for nothing more than a prance-about stage name.
ENTER
STRING Oh, please.
ENTER
STRING Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting? Because I'm feeling a little stung, Sting. Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!
ENTER
STRING That's not his real name?! You idiots!
ENTER
STRING Mr. Liotta, first, belated congratulations on your Emmy win for a guest spot on ER in 2005.
ENTER
STRING Thank you. Thank you.
ENTER
STRING I see from your resume that you're devilishly handsome with a churning inner turmoil that's ready to blow.
ENTER
STRING I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?
ENTER
STRING Not yet it isn't. But is this what it's come to for you? Exploiting tiny, helpless bees so you don't have to rehearse your part and learn your lines, sir?
ENTER
STRING Watch it, Benson! I could blow right now!
ENTER
STRING This isn't a goodfella.
ENTER
STRING This is a badfella!
ENTER
STRING Why doesn't someone just step on this creep, and we can all go home?!
ENTER
STRING Order in this court!
ENTER
STRING You're all thinking it!
ENTER
STRING Order! Order, I say!
ENTER
STRING Say it!
ENTER
STRING Mr. Liotta, please sit down!
ENTER
STRING I think it was awfully nice of that bear to pitch in like that. I think the jury's on our side.
ENTER
STRING Are we doing everything right, legally?
ENTER
STRING I'm a florist.
ENTER
STRING Right. Well, here's to a great team.
ENTER
STRING To a great team!
ENTER
STRING Well, hello.
ENTER
STRING Ken!
ENTER
STRING Hello.
ENTER
STRING I didn't think you were coming.
ENTER
STRING No, I was just late I tried to call, but... the battery.
ENTER
STRING I didn't want all this to go to waste,
ENTER
STRING so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.
ENTER
STRING Oh, that was lucky.
ENTER
STRING There's a little left. I could heat it up.
ENTER
STRING Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.
ENTER
STRING So I hear you're quite a tennis player. I'm not much for the game myself. The ball's a little grabby.
ENTER
STRING That's where I usually sit. Right... there.
ENTER
STRING Ken, Barry was looking at your resume, and he agreed with me that eating with chopsticks isn't really a special skill.
ENTER
STRING You think I don't see what you're doing?
ENTER
STRING I know how hard it is to find the right job. We have that in common.
ENTER
STRING Do we?
ENTER
STRING Bees have 100 percent employment, but we do jobs like taking the crud out.
ENTER
STRING That's just what I was thinking about doing.
ENTER
STRING Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor for his fuzz. I hope that was all right.
ENTER
STRING I'm going to drain the old stinger.
ENTER
STRING Yeah, you do that.
ENTER
STRING Look at that.
ENTER
STRING You know, I've just about had it with your little Mind Games.
ENTER
STRING What's that?
ENTER
STRING Italian Vogue.
ENTER
STRING Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages.
ENTER
STRING A lot of ads.
ENTER
STRING Remember what Van said, why is your life more valuable than mine?
ENTER
STRING Funny, I just can't seem to recall that! I think something stinks in here!
ENTER
STRING I love the smell of flowers.
ENTER
STRING How do you like the smell of flames?!
ENTER
STRING Not as much.
ENTER
STRING Water bug! Not taking sides!
ENTER
STRING Ken, I'm wearing a Chapstick hat!
ENTER
STRING This is pathetic!
ENTER
STRING I've got issues!
ENTER
STRING Well, well, well, a royal flush!
ENTER
STRING You're bluffing.
ENTER
STRING Am I?
ENTER
STRING Surf's up, dude!
ENTER
STRING Poo water!
ENTER
STRING That bowl is gnarly. Except for those dirty yellow rings!
ENTER
STRING Kenneth! What are you doing?!
ENTER
STRING You know, I don't even like honey! I don't eat it!
ENTER
STRING We need to talk! He's just a little bee!
ENTER
STRING And he happens to be the nicest bee I've met in a long time!
ENTER
STRING Long time? What are you talking about?! Are there other bugs in your life?
ENTER
STRING  No, but there are other things bugging me in life. And you're one of them!
ENTER
STRING Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...
ENTER
STRING My nerves are fried from riding on this emotional roller coaster!
ENTER
STRING Goodbye, Ken.
ENTER
STRING And for your information, I prefer sugar-free, artificial sweeteners made by man!
ENTER
STRING I'm sorry about all that.
ENTER
STRING I know it's got an aftertaste! I like it!
ENTER
STRING I always felt there was some kind of barrier between Ken and me. I couldn't overcome it.
ENTER
STRING Oh, well.
ENTER
STRING Are you OK for the trial?
ENTER
STRING I believe Mr. Montgomery is about out of ideas.
ENTER
STRING We would like to call Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.
ENTER
STRING Good idea! You can really see why he's considered one of the best lawyers...
ENTER
STRING Yeah.
ENTER
STRING Layton, you've gotta weave some magic with this jury, or it's gonna be all over.
ENTER
STRING Don't worry. The only thing I have to do to turn this jury around is to remind them of what they don't like about bees.
ENTER
STRING You got the tweezers?
ENTER
STRING Are you allergic?
ENTER
STRING Only to losing, son. Only to losing.
ENTER
STRING Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you what I think we'd all like to know.
ENTER
STRING What exactly is your relationship to that woman?
ENTER
STRING We're friends.
ENTER
STRING Good friends?
ENTER
STRING Yes.
ENTER
STRING How good? Do you live together?
ENTER
STRING Wait a minute... Are you her little... bedbug?
ENTER
STRING I've seen a bee documentary or two. From what I understand, doesn't your queen give birth to all the bee children?
ENTER
STRING Yeah, but...
ENTER
STRING So those aren't your real parents!
ENTER
STRING Oh, Barry...
ENTER
STRING Yes, they are!
ENTER
STRING Hold me back!
ENTER
STRING You're an illegitimate bee, aren't you, Benson?
ENTER
STRING He's denouncing bees!
ENTER
STRING Don't y'all date your cousins?
ENTER
STRING Objection!
ENTER
STRING I'm going to pincushion this guy!
ENTER
STRING Adam, don't! It's what he wants!
ENTER
STRING Oh, I'm hit!! Oh, lordy, I am hit!
ENTER
STRING Order! Order!
ENTER
STRING The venom! The venom is coursing through my veins! I have been felled by a winged beast of destruction! You see? You can't treat them like equals! They're striped savages! Stinging's the only thing they know! It's their way!
ENTER
STRING Adam, stay with me.
ENTER
STRING I can't feel my legs.
ENTER
STRING What Angel of Mercy will come forward to suck the poison from my heaving buttocks?
ENTER
STRING I will have order in this court. Order! Order, please!
ENTER
STRING The case of the honeybees versus the human race took a pointed Turn Against the bees yesterday when one of their legal team stung Layton T. Montgomery.
ENTER
STRING Hey, buddy.
ENTER
STRING Hey.
ENTER
STRING Is there much pain?
ENTER
STRING Yeah.
ENTER
STRING I... I blew the whole case, didn't I?
ENTER
STRING It doesn't matter. What matters is
ENTER
STRING you're alive. You could have died.
ENTER
STRING I'd be better off dead. Look at me.
ENTER
STRING They got it from the cafeteria downstairs, in a tuna sandwich. Look, there's a little celery still on it.
ENTER
STRING What was it like to sting someone?
ENTER
STRING I can't explain it. It was all... All adrenaline and then...and then ecstasy!
ENTER
STRING All right.
ENTER
STRING You think it was all a trap?
ENTER
STRING Of course. I'm sorry. I flew us right into this.
ENTER
STRING What were we thinking? Look at us. We're just a couple of bugs in this world.
ENTER
STRING What will the humans do to us if they win?
ENTER
STRING I don't know.
ENTER
STRING I hear they put the roaches in motels. That doesn't sound so bad.
ENTER
STRING Adam, they check in, but they don't check out!
ENTER
STRING Oh, my.
ENTER
STRING Could you get a nurse to close that window?
ENTER
STRING Why?
ENTER
STRING The smoke.
ENTER
STRING Bees don't smoke.
ENTER
STRING Right. Bees don't smoke.
ENTER
STRING Bees don't smoke!
ENTER
STRING But some bees are smoking.
ENTER
STRING That's it! That's our case!
ENTER
STRING It is? It's not over?
ENTER
STRING Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere.
ENTER
STRING Get back to the court and stall. Stall any way you can.
ENTER
STRING And assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tub.
ENTER
STRING Mr. Flayman.
ENTER
STRING Yes? Yes, Your Honor!
ENTER
STRING Where is the rest of your team?
ENTER
STRING Well, Your Honor, it's interesting. Bees are trained to fly haphazardly, and as a result, we don't make very good time.
ENTER
STRING I actually heard a funny story about...
ENTER
STRING Your Honor, haven't these ridiculous bugs taken up enough of this court's valuable time? How much longer will we allow these absurd shenanigans to go on?
ENTER
STRING They have presented no compelling evidence to support their charges against my clients, who run legitimate businesses.
ENTER
STRING I move for a complete dismissal of this entire case!
ENTER
STRING Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going to have to consider Mr. Montgomery's motion.
ENTER
STRING But you can't! We have a terrific case.
ENTER
STRING Where is your proof?
ENTER
STRING Where is the evidence?
ENTER
STRING Show me the smoking gun!
ENTER
STRING Hold it, Your Honor!
ENTER
STRING You want a smoking gun? Here is your smoking gun.
ENTER
STRING What is that?
ENTER
STRING It's a bee smoker!
ENTER
STRING What, this? This harmless little contraption? This couldn't hurt a fly, let alone a bee.
ENTER
STRING Look at what has happened to bees who have never been asked, "Smoking or non?" Is this what nature intended for us? To be forcibly addicted to smoke machines and man-made wooden slat work camps?
ENTER
STRING Living out our lives as honey slaves to the white man?
ENTER
STRING What are we gonna do?
ENTER
STRING He's playing the species card.
ENTER
STRING Ladies and gentlemen, please, free these bees!
ENTER
STRING Free the bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! Free the bees!
ENTER
STRING The court finds in favor of the bees!
ENTER
STRING Vanessa, we won!
ENTER
STRING I knew you could do it! High-five!
ENTER
STRING Sorry.
ENTER
STRING I'm OK! You know what this means?
ENTER
STRING All the honey will finally belong to the bees.
ENTER
STRING Now we won't have to work so hard all the time.
ENTER
STRING This is an unholy perversion of the balance of nature, Benson.
ENTER
STRING You'll regret this.
ENTER
STRING Barry, how much honey is out there?
ENTER
STRING All right. One at a time.
ENTER
STRING Barry, who are you wearing?
ENTER
STRING My sweater is Ralph Lauren, and I have no pants.
ENTER
STRING What if Montgomery's right?
ENTER
STRING What do you mean?
ENTER
STRING We've been living the bee way a long time, 27 million years.
ENTER
STRING Congratulations on your victory. What will you demand as a settlement?
ENTER
STRING First, we'll demand a complete shutdown of all bee work camps.
ENTER
STRING Then we want back the honey that was ours to begin with, every last drop.
ENTER
STRING We demand an end to the glorification of the bear as anything more than a filthy, smelly, bad-breath stink machine.
ENTER
STRING We're all aware of what they do in the woods.
ENTER
STRING Wait for my signal. Take him out.
ENTER
STRING He'll have nauseous for a few hours, then he'll be fine.
ENTER
STRING And we will no longer tolerate bee-negative nicknames...
ENTER
STRING But it's just a prance-about stage name!
ENTER
STRING ...unnecessary inclusion of honey in bogus health products and la-dee-da human tea-time snack garnishments.
ENTER
STRING Can't breathe.
ENTER
STRING Bring it in, boys!
ENTER
STRING Hold it right there! Good.
ENTER
STRING Tap it.
ENTER
STRING Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups and there's gallons more coming!
ENTER
STRING I think we need to shut down!
ENTER
STRING Shut down? We've never shut down.
ENTER
STRING Shut down honey production!
ENTER
STRING Stop making honey!
ENTER
STRING Turn your key, sir!
ENTER
STRING What do we do now?
ENTER
STRING Cannonball!
ENTER
STRING We're shutting honey production!
ENTER
STRING Mission abort.
ENTER
STRING Aborting pollination and nectar detail.
ENTER
STRING Returning to base.
ENTER
STRING Adam, you wouldn't believe how much honey was out there.
ENTER
STRING Oh, yeah?
ENTER
STRING What's going on? Where is everybody?
ENTER
STRING Are they out celebrating?
ENTER
STRING They're home.
ENTER
STRING They don't know what to do. Laying out, sleeping in.
ENTER
STRING I heard your Uncle Carl was on his way to San Antonio with a cricket.
ENTER
STRING At least we got our honey back.
ENTER
STRING Sometimes I think, so what if humans liked our honey? Who wouldn't?
ENTER
STRING It's the greatest thing in the world! I was excited to be part of making it.
ENTER
STRING This was my new desk. This was my new job. I wanted to do it really well. And now...
ENTER
STRING Now I can't.
ENTER
STRING I don't understand why they're not happy.
ENTER
STRING I thought their lives would be better!
ENTER
STRING They're doing nothing. It's amazing.
ENTER
STRING Honey really changes people.
ENTER
STRING You don't have any idea what's going on, do you?
ENTER
STRING What did you want to show me?
ENTER
STRING This.
ENTER
STRING What happened here?
ENTER
STRING That is not the half of it.
ENTER
STRING Oh, no. Oh, my.
ENTER
STRING They're all wilting.
ENTER
STRING Doesn't look very good, does it?
ENTER
STRING No.
ENTER
STRING And whose fault do you think that is?
ENTER
STRING You know, I'm gonna guess bees.
ENTER
STRING Bees?
ENTER
STRING Specifically, me.
ENTER
STRING I didn't think bees not needing to make honey would affect all these things.
ENTER
STRING It's not just flowers. Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees.
ENTER
STRING That's our whole SAT test right there.
ENTER
STRING Take away produce, that affects the entire animal kingdom.
ENTER
STRING And then, of course...
ENTER
STRING The human species?
ENTER
STRING So if there's no more pollination, it could all just go south here, couldn't it?
ENTER
STRING I know this is also partly my fault.
ENTER
STRING How about a suicide pact?
ENTER
STRING How do we do it?
ENTER
STRING I'll sting you, you step on me.
ENTER
STRING That just kills you twice.
ENTER
STRING Right, right.
ENTER
STRING Listen, Barry... sorry, but I gotta get going.
ENTER
STRING I had to open my mouth and talk.
ENTER
STRING Vanessa?
ENTER
STRING Vanessa? Why are you leaving?
ENTER
STRING Where are you going?
ENTER
STRING To the final Tournament of Roses parade in Pasadena.
ENTER
STRING They've moved it to this weekend because all the flowers are dying.
ENTER
STRING It's the Last Chance I'll ever have to see it.
ENTER
STRING Vanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry.
ENTER
STRING I never meant it to turn out like this.
ENTER
STRING I know. Me neither.
ENTER
STRING Tournament of Roses.
ENTER
STRING Roses can't do sports.
ENTER
STRING Wait a minute. Roses. Roses?
ENTER
STRING Roses!
ENTER
STRING Vanessa!
ENTER
STRING Roses?!
ENTER
STRING Barry?
ENTER
STRING Roses are flowers!
ENTER
STRING Yes, they are.
ENTER
STRING Flowers, bees, pollen!
ENTER
STRING I know.
ENTER
STRING That's why this is the last parade.
ENTER
STRING Maybe not.
ENTER
STRING Could you ask him to slow down?
ENTER
STRING Could you slow down?
ENTER
STRING Barry!
ENTER
STRING OK, I made a huge mistake.
ENTER
STRING This is a total disaster, all my fault.
ENTER
STRING Yes, it kind of is.
ENTER
STRING I've ruined the planet. I wanted to help you with the flower shop. I've made it worse.
ENTER
STRING Actually, it's completely closed down.
ENTER
STRING I thought maybe you were remodeling.
ENTER
STRING But I have another idea, and it's greater than my previous ideas combined.
ENTER
STRING I don't want to hear it!
ENTER
STRING All right, they have the roses, the roses have the pollen.
ENTER
STRING I know every bee, plant and flower bud in this park.
ENTER
STRING All we gotta do is get what they've got back here with what we've got.
ENTER
STRING Bees.
ENTER
STRING Park.
ENTER
STRING Pollen!
ENTER
STRING Flowers.
ENTER
STRING Repollination!
ENTER
STRING Across the nation!
ENTER
STRING Tournament of Roses, Pasadena, California.
ENTER
STRING They've got nothing but flowers, floats and cotton candy.
ENTER
STRING Security will be tight.
ENTER
STRING I have an idea.
ENTER
STRING Vanessa Bloome, FTD.
ENTER
STRING Official floral business. It's real.
ENTER
STRING Sorry, ma'am. Nice brooch.
ENTER
STRING Thank you. It was a gift.
ENTER
STRING Once inside, we just pick the right float.
ENTER
STRING How about The Princess and the Pea?
ENTER
STRING I could be the princess, and you could be the pea!
ENTER
STRING Yes, I got it.
ENTER
STRING Where should I sit?
ENTER
STRING What are you?
ENTER
STRING I believe I'm the pea.
ENTER
STRING The pea?
ENTER
STRING It goes under the mattresses.
ENTER
STRING Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart.
ENTER
STRING I'm getting the marshal.
ENTER
STRING You do that! This whole parade is a fiasco!
ENTER
STRING Let's see what this baby'll do.
ENTER
STRING Hey, what are you doing?!
ENTER
STRING Then all we do is blend in with traffic... without arousing suspicion.
ENTER
STRING Once at the airport, there's no stopping us.
ENTER
STRING Stop! Security.
ENTER
STRING You and your insect pack your float?
ENTER
STRING Yes.
ENTER
STRING Has it been in your possession the entire time?
ENTER
STRING Would you remove your shoes?
ENTER
STRING Remove your stinger.
ENTER
STRING It's part of me.
ENTER
STRING I know. Just having some fun.
ENTER
STRING Enjoy your flight.
ENTER
STRING Then if we're lucky, we'll have just enough pollen to do the job.
ENTER
STRING Can you believe how lucky we are? We have just enough pollen to do the job!
ENTER
STRING I think this is gonna work.
ENTER
STRING It's got to work.
ENTER
STRING Attention, passengers, this is Captain Scott. We have a bit of bad weather in New York. It looks like we'll experience a couple hours delay.
ENTER
STRING Barry, these are cut flowers with no water. They'll never make it.
ENTER
STRING I gotta get up there and talk to them.
ENTER
STRING Be careful.
ENTER
STRING Can I get help with the Sky Mall magazine? I'd like to order the talking inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer.
ENTER
STRING Captain, I'm in a real situation.
ENTER
STRING What'd you say, Hal?
ENTER
STRING Nothing.
ENTER
STRING Bee!
ENTER
STRING Don't freak out! My entire species...
ENTER
STRING What are you doing?
ENTER
STRING Wait a minute! I'm an attorney!
ENTER
STRING Who's an attorney?
ENTER
STRING Don't move.
ENTER
STRING Oh, Barry.
ENTER
STRING Good afternoon, passengers. This is your captain. Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B please report to the cockpit? And please hurry!
ENTER
STRING What happened here?
ENTER
STRING There was a DustBuster, a toupee, a life raft exploded.
ENTER
STRING One's bald, one's in a boat, they're both unconscious!
ENTER
STRING Is that another bee joke?
ENTER
STRING No!
ENTER
STRING No one's flying the plane!
ENTER
STRING This is JFK control tower, Flight 356. What's your status?
ENTER
STRING This is Vanessa Bloome. I'm a florist from New York.
ENTER
STRING Where's the pilot?
ENTER
STRING He's unconscious, and so is the copilot.
ENTER
STRING Not good. Does anyone onboard have flight experience?
ENTER
STRING As a matter of fact, there is.
ENTER
STRING Who's that?
ENTER
STRING Barry Benson.
ENTER
STRING From the honey trial?! Oh, great.
ENTER
STRING Vanessa, this is nothing more than a big metal bee.
ENTER
STRING It's got giant wings, huge engines.
ENTER
STRING I can't fly a plane.
ENTER
STRING Why not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot?
ENTER
STRING Yes.
ENTER
STRING How hard could it be?
ENTER
STRING Wait, Barry!
ENTER
STRING We're headed into some lightning.
ENTER
STRING This is Bob Bumble. We have some late-breaking news from JFK Airport, where a suspenseful scene is developing.
ENTER
STRING Barry Benson, fresh from his legal victory...
ENTER
STRING That's Barry!
ENTER
STRING ...is attempting to land a plane, loaded with people, flowers and an incapacitated flight crew.
ENTER
STRING Flowers?!
ENTER
STRING We have a storm in the area and two individuals at the controls with absolutely no flight experience.
ENTER
STRING Just a minute. There's a bee on that plane.
ENTER
STRING I'm quite familiar with Mr. Benson and his no-account compadres.
ENTER
STRING They've done enough damage.
ENTER
STRING But isn't he your only hope?
ENTER
STRING Technically, a bee shouldn't be able to fly at all.
ENTER
STRING Their wings are too small... Haven't we heard this a million times?
ENTER
STRING "The surface area of the wings and body mass make no sense."
ENTER
STRING Get this on the air!
ENTER
STRING Got it.
ENTER
STRING Stand by.
ENTER
STRING We're going live.
ENTER
STRING The way we work may be a mystery to you. Making honey takes a lot of bees doing a lot of small jobs.
ENTER
STRING But let me tell you about a small job. If you do it well, it makes a big difference.
ENTER
STRING More than we realized. To us, to everyone.
ENTER
STRING That's why I want to get bees back to working together. That's the bee way! We're not made of Jell-O.
ENTER
STRING We get behind a fellow.
ENTER
STRING Black and yellow!
ENTER
STRING Hello!
ENTER
STRING Left, right, down, hover.
ENTER
STRING Hover?
ENTER
STRING Forget hover.
ENTER
STRING This isn't so hard.
ENTER
STRING Beep-beep! Beep-beep!
ENTER
STRING Barry, what happened?!
ENTER
STRING Wait, I think we were on autopilot the whole time.
ENTER
STRING That may have been helping me.
ENTER
STRING And now we're not!
ENTER
STRING So it turns out I cannot fly a plane.
ENTER
STRING All of you, let's get behind this fellow! Move it out!
ENTER
STRING Move out!
ENTER
STRING Our only chance is if I do what I'd do, you copy me with the wings of the plane!
ENTER
STRING Don't have to yell.
ENTER
STRING I'm not yelling! We're in a lot of trouble.
ENTER
STRING It's very hard to concentrate with that panicky tone in your voice!
ENTER
STRING It's not a tone. I'm panicking!
ENTER
STRING I can't do this!
ENTER
STRING Vanessa, pull yourself together. You have to snap out of it!
ENTER
STRING You snap out of it.
ENTER
STRING You snap out of it.
ENTER
STRING You snap out of it!
ENTER
STRING You snap out of it!
ENTER
STRING You snap out of it!
ENTER
STRING You snap out of it!
ENTER
STRING You snap out of it!
ENTER
STRING You snap out of it!
ENTER
STRING Hold it!
ENTER
STRING Why? Come on, it's my turn.
ENTER
STRING How is the plane flying?
ENTER
STRING I don't know.
ENTER
STRING Hello?
ENTER
STRING Benson, got any flowers for a happy occasion in there?
ENTER
STRING The Pollen Jocks!
ENTER
STRING They do get behind a fellow.
ENTER
STRING Black and yellow.
ENTER
STRING Hello.
ENTER
STRING All right, let's drop this tin can on the blacktop.
ENTER
STRING Where? I can't see anything. Can you?
ENTER
STRING No, nothing. It's all cloudy.
ENTER
STRING Come on. You got to think bee, Barry.
ENTER
STRING Thinking bee.
ENTER
STRING Thinking bee.
ENTER
STRING Thinking bee!
ENTER
STRING Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
ENTER
STRING Wait a minute. I think I'm feeling something.
ENTER
STRING What?
ENTER
STRING I don't know. It's strong, pulling me.
ENTER
STRING Like a 27-million-year-old instinct.
ENTER
STRING Bring the nose down.
ENTER
STRING Thinking bee!
ENTER
STRING Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
ENTER
STRING What in the world is on the tarmac?
ENTER
STRING Get some lights on that!
ENTER
STRING Thinking bee!
ENTER
STRING Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
ENTER
STRING Vanessa, aim for the flower.
ENTER
STRING OK.
ENTER
STRING Cut the engines. We're going in on bee power. Ready, boys?
ENTER
STRING Affirmative!
ENTER
STRING Good. Good. Easy, now. That's it.
ENTER
STRING Land on that flower!
ENTER
STRING Ready? Full reverse!
ENTER
STRING Spin it around!
ENTER
STRING Not that flower! The other one!
ENTER
STRING Which one?
ENTER
STRING That flower.
ENTER
STRING I'm aiming at the flower!
ENTER
STRING That's a fat guy in a flowered shirt.
ENTER
STRING I mean the giant pulsating flower made of millions of bees!
ENTER
STRING Pull forward. Nose down. Tail up.
ENTER
STRING Rotate around it.
ENTER
STRING This is insane, Barry!
ENTER
STRING This's the only way I know how to fly.
ENTER
STRING Am I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane flying in an insect-like pattern?
ENTER
STRING Get your nose in there. Don't be afraid. Smell it. Full reverse!
ENTER
STRING Just drop it. Be a part of it.
ENTER
STRING Aim for the center!
ENTER
STRING Now drop it in! Drop it in, woman!
ENTER
STRING Come on, already.
ENTER
STRING Barry, we did it! You taught me how to fly!
ENTER
STRING Yes. No high-five!
ENTER
STRING Right.
ENTER
STRING Barry, it worked!
ENTER
STRING Did you see the giant flower?
ENTER
STRING What giant flower? Where? Of course
ENTER
STRING I saw the flower! That was genius!
ENTER
STRING Thank you.
ENTER
STRING But we're not done yet.
ENTER
STRING Listen, everyone!
ENTER
STRING This runway is covered with the last pollen from the last flowers available anywhere on Earth.
ENTER
STRING That means this is our Last Chance. We're the only ones who make honey, pollinate flowers and dress like this.
ENTER
STRING If we're gonna survive as a species, this is our moment! What do you say?
ENTER
STRING Are we going to be bees, or just Museum of Natural History keychains?
ENTER
STRING We're bees!
ENTER
STRING Keychain!
ENTER
STRING Then follow me! Except Keychain.
ENTER
STRING Hold on, Barry. Here. You've earned this.
ENTER
STRING Yeah!
ENTER
STRING I'm a Pollen Jock! And it's a perfect fit. All I gotta do are the sleeves.
ENTER
STRING Oh, yeah.
ENTER
STRING That's our Barry.
ENTER
STRING Mom! The bees are back!
ENTER
STRING If anybody needs to make a call, now's the time. I got a feeling we'll be working late tonight!
ENTER
STRING Here's your change. Have a great afternoon! Can I help who's next?
ENTER
STRING Would you like some honey with that?
ENTER
STRING It is bee-approved. Don't forget these.
ENTER
STRING Milk, cream, cheese, it's all me.  And I don't see a nickel!
ENTER
STRING Sometimes I just feel like a piece of meat!
ENTER
STRING I had no idea.
ENTER
STRING Barry, I'm sorry.
ENTER
STRING Have you got a moment?
ENTER
STRING Would you excuse me?
ENTER
STRING My mosquito associate will help you.
ENTER
STRING Sorry I'm late.
ENTER
STRING He's a lawyer too?
ENTER
STRING I was already a blood-sucking parasite. All I needed was a briefcase.
ENTER
STRING Have a great afternoon!
ENTER
STRING Barry, I just got this huge tulip order, and I can't get them anywhere.
ENTER
STRING No problem, Vannie. Just leave it to me.
ENTER
STRING You're a lifesaver, Barry. Can I help who's next?
ENTER
STRING All right, scramble, jocks! It's time to fly.
ENTER
STRING Thank you, Barry!
ENTER
STRING That bee is living my life!
ENTER
STRING Let it go, Kenny.
ENTER
STRING When will this nightmare end?!
ENTER
STRING Let it all go.
ENTER
STRING Beautiful day to fly.
ENTER
STRING Sure is.
ENTER
STRING Between you and me,
ENTER
STRING I was dying to get out of that office.
ENTER
STRING You have got to start thinking bee, my friend.
ENTER
STRING Thinking bee!
ENTER
STRING Me?
ENTER
STRING Hold it. Let's just stop for a second. Hold it.
ENTER
STRING I'm sorry. I'm sorry, everyone. Can we stop here?
ENTER
STRING I'm not making a major life decision during a production number!
ENTER
STRING All right. Take ten, everybody. Wrap it up, guys.
ENTER
STRING I had virtually no rehearsal for that.
